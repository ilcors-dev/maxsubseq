## Maximum Common Subsequence
The program finds the maximum common subsequence of two strings.

It provides multiple implementations of the algorithm, each with different time and space complexity.

The program also provides a benchmarking tool to compare the performance of the different implementations.

Based on the following paper: https://ioi.di.unimi.it/maxsubseq.pdf
